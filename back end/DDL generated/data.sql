('Base','Painting miniatures has always been a rather niche hobby, but in recent years, thanks to a very active community on social media and a general improvement in the quality of the miniatures themselves, it is spreading more and more. If you are reading this article you will probably have been fascinated by the sight of an army of a beautifully painted wargame, or maybe you have (or you have) given yourself a board game with miniatures and you think that those models so flat and gray miss something. Does painting miniature board games make us nerdy losers in everyone’s eyes? Maybe so. If you don’t do it in style. Coloring models, painting plastic soldiers, collecting armies and everything that revolves around the hobby of miniatures and modeling painting may seem complicated, but do not despair! Today the network offers us all the necessary teachings to start painting miniatures.','Painting Miniatures: Guide'),
('Base',
'Before starting to paint miniatures you need an important premise: on the internet it is easy to come across works of excellent quality that if on the one hand intrigue and push to approach the hobby, On the other hand, they can be intimidating if you want to match them.

Know that the best works are often made by professional studio artists and that the vast majority of us will hardly ever reach that level. But fear not, you do not need to be real artists to paint miniatures satisfactorily and even a basic level painting will be enough to give life to the models on the gaming table, to the benefit of fun and immersion.

So here’s how to paint your thumbnails using some simple techniques. After this overview we will talk about some advanced techniques and finally we will see in detail all the indispensable tools for this purpose.

BACKGROUND PREPARATION AND COLOUR
If the miniature is sold attached to a sprue, you must first remove it carefully. Do not underestimate this part and use a cutter or clippers: detaching the parts using only your hands will create, in most cases, a real hole in the junction point with the sprue.

At this point with a small file or a cutter go to clean up the residues of the sprue and the so-called fusion lines (mold lines). These are fine embossed lines that form along the junction of the two parts of the mold. Although it seems an insignificant detail, if left in their place they will be highlighted by the painting techniques you will use, ruining the final result.

Assembly at this stage is an optional operation and depends very much on the number of pieces and the laying of the miniature. Some areas may be very difficult to reach when the model is fully assembled, so many prefer to paint each piece individually or divide it into subgroups. It is a good idea at this point to wash and dry the miniatures: any residue of dirt and lubricants used during production could favor the detachment of the paint. Just a hand soap and an old toothbrush.

Let’s finally apply the background color, more commonly called Primer, a first layer of paint on which the following will adhere much more easily. This is generally applied with a spray can, finishing with the brush any areas not reached by the jet. Prefer this to giving too much "spray" because a layer of paint too often would make smaller details disappear.

BASIC COLOUR
Let’s finally take action. You may have seen a color scheme you like on the internet or want to practice your long studies on the Munsell wheel: in any case it’s time to choose colors and apply them to the thumbnail.

Choose medium tones, neither too light nor too dark, and apply them starting from the most recessed parts to rise gradually to the most raised parts. Don’t worry too much about being accurate in painting the miniature at this stage, once dry any smudges can be corrected by simply covering them with another color. It’s time to introduce a golden rule, to keep in mind: dilute your colors!

The risk of painting miniatures with too dense a paint is to go and cover all those small details that make them beautiful and fulfilling: inlays, rings and other small decorations, as well as eyes, are really very small details and easy to make disappear with a paint not properly diluted.

When diluted, the color is obviously less opaque. It will therefore be perfectly normal to have to give at least two hands (or even more in the case of colors tendentially hostile as yellow or green) to obtain a uniform color. This takes a lot of time and patience, but don’t give in to the temptation to skip this step! After all to take away time (and money) is exactly what does a hobby and to paint miniatures is not to be outdone.

WASHING OR WASHING
Washing is a very simple technique that will give an extra edge to any model, creating shadows and defining the contours of all the details, enhancing them. It consists in the application, even very coarse, of a very diluted ink on the whole miniature, darker than the base color on which it is applied. The most commonly used is, banally, black. This will spontaneously settle into the recesses and edges of the surfaces, the parts that would naturally be in the shade, making a very realistic effect.

The complete drying takes a long time, but once finished it will be enough to go to retouch those points more in relief that the ink has soiled, using the base color again.','How to Paint miniatures: Basic Techniques to get Started'),
('Intermediate','If everything went smoothly at this point you will have a miniature painted with a decent Tabletop Quality, a term commonly used to define a level of painting not particularly detailed but that makes it more than worthy during the game, when the scene is viewed from a distance that would not allow you to appreciate the details. A gaming table populated entirely with painted miniatures provides, even at this level, a glance of sure effect.

But if you are passionate about the hobby and want to go further, here are some additional techniques to paint miniatures at a higher level.

DRY BRUSH OR DRY BRUSHING
Dry Brushing is actually a very simple technique to perform, it only takes a little care not to dirty too much the areas not affected (which, in any case, will happen) and gives excellent results on very textured surfaces such as fur, scales or ring armor. It can also be used on other parts such as clothing, but with lower results than the lumeggiatura (which we will see later) with the only advantage over the latter to be much faster.

White lion fur is a perfect textured surface to use the dry brush technique.

To paint the miniature dry brush take a flat or rounded tip brush (however not the fine tip that you use on all other occasions) and paint it in a lighter color than the base color of the affected area. Now put it on a dry napkin to remove most of the color: you will get to a point where the brush leaves practically no marks on the napkin. In reality there is still a lot of paint nested between the bristles that is deposited on the most raised parts of the miniature. Rub the brush on the miniature quickly and always in the same direction, for example from top to bottom (where the light comes from!), for an optimal result. Dry Brushing is an uncontrollable technique, with which you will almost certainly go to dirty parts that do not interest you. Then use it immediately after washing and correct the errors before proceeding.

ILLUMINATION OR LAYERING
The techniques seen so far are rather standardized and "scholastic": they have precise rules and can be easily used even by novice painters. The real artistic side of the hobby comes into play here, and it’s here that a one-piece Tabletop Quality miniature comes into play.

Lumeggiare basically consists in applying on the base color layers of color increasingly lighter on the parts in relief. At each step will be applied a color increasingly lighter on a part increasingly narrower: in this way all the layers should remain visible to form a gradient, a transition ideally homogeneous between the parts in darker recess (in shadow) and those in clearer relief, where the light hits. How many shades of color to apply and where to apply them is to your sensitivity and requires some practice.

An example of simple 2-level illumination

Try to observe the world around you by paying attention to how reflections and shadows form on objects. There is an interesting reading about it, it is not specific for miniatures but the concepts can safely be taken up and applied: Color and Light - James Gurney

You can extrapolate a small, but useful general rule: illuminating the edge of an object or a sharp edge will, in most cases, give an excellent result.

The Mark X "Tacticus" Power Armour of the Space Marines lends itself very well to the lightening on the edges thanks to its well-defined edges

Color dilution is particularly important at this stage because it helps to make the transition more homogeneous and, since you will apply different layers of color, it will avoid the formation of unsightly "montagnette".

WET BLENDING
Wet blending is a variant of lumeggiatura that aims to paint shades on miniatures with a perfectly homogeneous transition between a dark and a lighter color. It requires a lot of practice and cold blood, because you will mess directly on the miniature, with the risk of making a disaster. Wet blending works like this: you apply a dark tone on one area of the model, after which, very quickly before the paint dries, you apply a lighter tone on an adjacent area. At this point you have to mix the two tones along the contact line, then go to make the transition directly on the model. Don’t worry, if you are interested on YouTube you will find many tutorials about it. And if you are very curious you might start to see Glazing too.

Using properly Layering and Wet Blending you can get incredible results like the one I propose in the next image. The artist goes by the name of Hendarion, go find him because it’s worth it. Hendarion also developed an app called Brushrage to keep track of the time you spend painting and the colors you used in your projects.

PAINTING THE INCARNATE MINIATURES AND EYES: THE FACES OF THE MINIATURES
Painting the faces of miniatures is an interesting example of enlightenment. To paint the complexion of the miniatures parts from a medium tone, a tanned skin, and then apply a lighter tone on the forehead, nose and cheeks coming to a very light pink (almost white) for the tip of the nose, eyebrows and cheekbones. On the contrary, you will leave the darker shades, obtainable with a sepia wash, on the sides of the nose, under the chin or in the space between two fingers of a hand. Since we are on the subject of faces, we also see a way to paint the eyes: start by painting the entire black eye, then carefully make two white dots on the sides, leaving the black in the center and on the outer edge to serve as a contour.

('Base','If at this point you have decided to try but you still have no miniature to paint, know that you are spoiled for choice. If you want to engage in a traditional wargame, in which a large slice of time is spent collecting and painting an entire army, surely Games Workshop is the master with its famous Warhammer and Warhammer 40000, as well as the official line of The Lord of the Rings.

You may want to make your sessions at D&D or Pathfinder more engaging, in which case both Scibor Miniatures and Wizkids offer a beautiful line of fantasy miniatures to paint.

Lighting and blending, combined with the vibrant colors used by Hendarion, give an exceptional result

If you prefer a more casual approach, without having to get many miniatures and study long game manuals, a box game with thumbnails is definitely the one for you. There are now many games of this type that combine a fun and successful gameplay with miniatures of excellent quality, and have the advantage of offering in a single package all you need to start playing. Among the most famous are the various incarnations of:

('Base','The widely used miniature paints are definitely acrylic paints. Acrylic paints on plastic and metal have the advantage of drying very quickly and being soluble and dilutable in simple water. It happens to see some artists who use oil paints, but it is mostly a virtuosity for its own sake: the real distinction is between painting with acrylic paints using a brush or an airbrush. All the techniques seen so far referred to painting with the classic brush, the simplest and the least demanding from the point of view of the necessary equipment. Here are some examples of what the miniature color market offers.

GAMES WORKSHOP
Games Workshop is the most famous manufacturer of miniatures is living in recent years a second renaissance, thanks to a series of new miniatures both fantasy and science fiction modern design and eye-catching with a constructive quality at the highest levels. It is also focusing strongly on other media (books, video games, comics and, in the near future, TV series) to deeply characterize characters and settings. As if that were not enough, it has completely revolutionized its products dedicated to painting, offering a very wide range of high quality colors and above all inventing a rational system aimed at reassuring and attracting newbies. Finally, it has a nice YouTube channel where it loads a few minutes tutorial dedicated to a specific color, effect or miniature.

A particular line might interest you if you want to paint quickly, while getting a discreet effect of light and shadow: the Contrast Paint. YouTube has many tutorials if you want to see them in action.

The rationality of the Citadel method: do you want to color this miniature? Buy these colors. Period.

By contrast, Games Workshop is not exactly cheap: the price goes on 0.30€ per milliliter, about twice its competitors.

VALLEJO
Vallejo is a very famous Spanish brand in the field of fine arts and, by all accounts, a great product. It also offers a miniature color line called Vallejo Game Color. Honestly I did not feel comfortable with these colors: the colors Vallejo in my opinion are too little opaque. Of course, it is always better to give more coats of diluted color, but exaggerating leads to a non-homogeneous surface with a "mottled" effect.

This was my particular experience and on YouTube you will surely find someone who will explain how to use them properly, showing off the mediocre painter I am, so here’s where to find a nice basic set or specific sets and colors.

THE ARMY PAINTER
The Army Painter is a fairly recent brand specializing exclusively in colors for miniatures and other accessories. It has a good quality/ price ratio and above all offers a wide range of specific kits for many Boardgames with successful miniatures. These kits contain a selection of colors with which a newbie can safely paint the entire set of miniatures in the game to which they refer and are, moreover, a nice gift idea for the friend who purchased it.

GREEN STUFF WORLD
Green Stuff World is a very recent brand that is making its way into the community for its particular and innovative products (100 skulls for less than 10€? Yes, thank you). Born mainly as a dealer of tools for sculpture and the creation of scenarios and models, but has recently launched its own line of colors for miniatures.

Prices are similar to those of The Army Painter and offers, in addition to a basic kit with primary colors, a series of kits specific for color: for example in the kit dedicated to blue there are 6 different gradations already ready, which will make it easier to highlight that particular color.
Finally, it offers very special products such as fluorescent paints, iridescent paints or a special conductive paint with which to electrify your models (has anyone talked about lightsabers?).

('Basic','Now let’s see what the tools are related to this hobby. Among these the only indispensable are only brushes, but the others will make, with little expense, the work much easier, faster and more accurate.

BRUSHES FOR PAINTING MINIATURES
Net of everything you can invest in, nothing will make a difference like a good brush. The brushes to paint ideal miniatures should not be, contrary to what you may think, very small, indeed you will find yourself working most of the time with a measuring brush 1 or 0, preserving a 5/0 or 10/0 brush for smaller details like small gems or eyes. The fundamental characteristic of the brush is that it has a good tip and that it keeps it for a long time (assuming the due maintenance).

Brushes are mainly divided into two categories: synthetic and Kolinsky.

BRUSHES IN SYNTHETIC FIBRE
Synthetic brushes are made from synthetic fibers and are the most common. Their quality can vary a lot, from cheap baby brush sets sold everywhere, to great products specific to this hobby. All the above mentioned brands of acrylic paints offer their own line of brushes, but there are also valid generic alternatives on Amazon. Compared to the Kolinskys they are cheaper and need less maintenance.

In addition to general brush tip brushes, there are also specific brushes for the dry brush technique, so a wider brush with a flat or rounded tip is preferable. In addition to having a worse performance, a classic brush would see its tip damaged very quickly by this technique, so it is definitely advisable to get an ad hoc brush.

KOLINSKY MARTEN HAIR BRUSHES
Kolinsky brushes have always been considered the ultimate in brushes. Animal rights activists don’t want that, but they’re made exclusively from the fur of Mustela Sibirica, commonly known as Martora Kolinsky or Siberian Weasel, a cute little animal that would be quiet in Siberia if it were not for the unfortunate feature of having the best hair for the realization of brushes for water paints.

Siberian weasel with brush mantle
The Siberian weasel thinks that a synthetic brush is more than valid to begin with.

They are obviously more expensive and require a little more attention, but they guarantee a handling and fluidity unmatched by synthetic fibers.

If you really want them, treat them well and they will last you a long time.

FILES AND WIRE CUTTERS
If your miniatures to paint come from a boxed game you should not need them but if, for example, you are going to paint miniatures of Warhammer know that first you have to remove them from the casting on which they are sold, clean them and assemble them.

MINIATURE WIRE CUTTERS
The miniature cutters differ from any wire cutters you find at the hardware store to have the blade flush with the back of the pliers. This allows you to place the clipper on the miniature to be detached and have a precise cut without carrying any residual sprue.

LIME PER MINIATURE
Le lime invece vi saranno utili per rimuovere i piccoli residui del taglio e, soprattutto, le antiestetiche linee di fusione. Le lime per modellismo sono dette “ad ago” con denti a diamante, di dimensioni intorno ai 4mm. Questo tipo di lima è quello che garantisce la finitura migliore ed ha le dimensioni giuste per lavorare anche in spazi angusti.

WET PALETTE
The Wet Palette is an interesting tool that you’ll see use in any video tutorial. It is basically a wet sponge with a sheet of paper slightly permeable to water. The paper exudes a small amount of water from the sponge to the top where the color is put, which will be diluted and kept usable for a long time. If everything is put in a tightly closed container, the color will remain usable even between one painting session and the other, very useful to save money or not to have to recreate from scratch a mix of colors that you want to reuse later.

A wet palette can safely be made at home: the mysterious permeable paper is trivial parchment paper, while as a sponge will suit any kitchen sponge. The real problem lies in the container: the ideal container is very low not to be uncomfortable to use, made of plastic to avoid damage in constant contact with water, wide enough to allow many colors to be applied and with a closure that does not evaporate the water too quickly. I challenge you to find something like this at home or at the supermarket. The only one who has succeeded (and in style) is Marco Frisoni in this video.

Alternatively, here are some commercial proposals. The cost is not excessive and they come with 50 pre-cut sheets of the right size.

HOLDER AND PATAFIX
Finally, I want to recommend an article that your hand will thank me for. Holding a small miniature between the fingers brings the hand in an unnatural position, which in the long run strains the tendons and makes it difficult to rotate to observe it from different angles. It will often slip into your hands at the risk of breaking. Here then comes to our aid a Holder, a tool on which to fix the miniature and that has a handle wide enough not to strain the hand.

A very nice wooden holder
The Games Workshop Holder is surprisingly inexpensive
Patafix - cork stopper not included
A cheap alternative? Treat yourself to a pack of Blue-Tack, known in Italy as Patafix. You can use it to attach the miniature, for example, to a cork, as well as a thousand other things. Your life will be better with Patafix.

Finally if you have a 3D printer, here is the printable holder I’m using, in combination with the Patafix
